I'm generally sceptical about alternatives of tools that work just fine like
IRB. And I really like IRB. So why Pry? And why everywhere? Because _Pry
features blew my mind_. When I wrote [about IRB
customization](/writing/why-you-should-spend-some-time-configuring-irb), I was
doing what I always do when I like a tool: customize it in order to make it more
familiar with my way of thinking. So, when I run into
[Pry](http://pry.github.com/), some of its features blew my mind because they
were exactly what I really wanted in IRB. For example, sometimes I like to
quickly explore a class or an object. The way you can do it with Pry feels
natural and intuitive:

```ruby
1.9.2 (main):0 > cd Array
1.9.2 (Array):1 > ls -m
[:[], :allocate, :new, :superclass, :toy, :try_convert, :yaml_tag]
1.9.2 (Array):1 > show-
show-command show-doc show-input show-method show-source
1.9.2 (Array):1 > show-method toy

From: /home/lucapette/.pryrc @ line 15:
Number of lines: 3

def self.toy(n=10, &block)
  block_given? ? Array.new(n,&block) : Array.new(n) { |i| i+1 }
end
```

Toy is a little method I have in my
[.pryrc](https://github.com/lucapette/dotfiles/blob/main/pryrc) (and
previously in my .irbrc) that I use when I want to play with arrays. Pry comes
with wonderful commands like cd that operates both with classes and instance
objects or like ls that you can use to list all the class methods (-m option)
or instance methods (-M option). And a very long list of other terrific
features as [editor
integration](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Editor-integration), [shell
integration](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Shell-Integration) or [gist
integration](http://rdoc.info/github/banister/pry/master/file/README.markdown#Gist_integration).
But I don't need to persuade you to use Pry because I'm sure you will use it
after taking a look at [these](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki)
[wonderful](http://vimeo.com/26391171)
[resources](http://railscasts.com/episodes/280-pry-with-rails).

The title of this article is "Pry everywhere" so let me show you what I've done
to migrate to Pry. There are existing of solutions but they all involve
something I don't like especially about their rails integration. My requirements
were fairly simple:

- I don't want to lose the customizations I've done with IRB
- The same for rails console
- I don't want to add any gem (although
  [this](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails) is very nicely done) to my Gemfile
  in rails projects.

After some researching, I came up with the following solution:

My current .irbrc:

```ruby

# https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/issues/183#issuecomment-1149953

if defined?(::Bundler)
  global*gemset = ENV['GEM_PATH'].split(':').grep(/ruby.*@global/).first
  if global*gemset
    all_global_gem_paths = Dir.glob("#{global_gemset}/gems/*")
      all_global_gem_paths.each do |p|
        gem_path = "#{p}/lib"
        $LOAD_PATH << gem_path
      end
   end
end

# Use Pry everywhere

require "rubygems"
require 'pry'
Pry.start
exit
```

In short, every time I start IRB I start a Pry session. It feels like a dirty
solution and I'm not sure if it has any issues. For now, it's working just fine
with my requirements. The bundler code is necessary to require pry and other
gems from rvm global gemset in a rails console without declaring them in the
Gemfile. Then, in the .pryrc I have:

```ruby

# vim FTW

Pry.config.editor = "gvim --nofork"

# My pry is polite

Pry.hooks = { :after_session => proc { puts "bye-bye" } }

# Prompt with ruby version

Pry.prompt = [proc { |obj, nest_level| "#{RUBY_VERSION} (#{obj}):#{nest_level} > " }, proc { |obj, nest_level| "#{RUBY_VERSION} (#{obj}):#{nest_level} * " }]

%w{map_by_method hirb}.each { |gem| require gem }

# Toys methods

# Stole from https://gist.github.com/807492
class Array
  def self.toy(n=10, &block)
    block_given? ? Array.new(n,&block) : Array.new(n) {|i| i+1}
  end
end

class Hash
  def self.toy(n=10)
    Hash[Array.toy(n).zip(Array.toy(n){|c| (96+(c+1)).chr})]
  end
end

# loading rails configuration if it is running as a rails console

load File.dirname(**FILE**) + '/.railsrc' if defined?(Rails) && Rails.env

```

If you compare this file with my previous
[.irbrc](https://github.com/lucapette/dotfiles/blob/80eade149f8d6b93b5446efd03606690b4e74ca6/irbrc)
you'll notice that this one is shorter. It means that Pry is indeed doing part
of what I want by default, like colors and [history
commands](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/History). My .railsrc is very similar
to the previous one minus one difference that is relevant to hirb users:

```ruby
# https://github.com/cldwalker/hirb/issues/46#issuecomment-1870823

Pry.config.print = proc do |output, value|
  Hirb::View.view_or_page_output(value) || Pry::DEFAULT_PRINT.call(output, value)
end

Hirb.enable
```

This makes [Hirb](https://github.com/cldwalker/hirb) work flawlessly. The
combination of Rails and Pry is fantastic. Give it a try!
