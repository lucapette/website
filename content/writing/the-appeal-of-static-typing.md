Before I dive into the topic, let me make a few premises:

- The point of this article isn't to say that statically typed languages are better
  than dynamically typed ones. That means nothing.
- I won't try to convince you that you should drop your favourite language
  and go for the ones I'll talk about in the article.
- I have problems expressing my opinion when I consider something "too obvious".
  I think that statically typed languages lead to a better programming
  experience. And I do think it's obvious. So here we are, I never say no to a
  writing challenge.

These premises should clarify that I mean everything that follows as _my_
personal opinion. I'm sharing my experience hoping that it may be useful to
other people.

## How I got here

I started my programming journey at the end of the year 2000. I was a computer
science student at the University of Naples, Italy. We did mostly C. I liked it:
it was difficult but satisfying.

After I graduated, I did Java for a better part of the first decade of my
professional career. The language and its ecosystem felt powerful but
unproductive.

In 2009, I finally was in a position to start looking for something different.
That's how I found Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  As an exercise, I tried to build a
prototype version of a new product my team had been working on for a couple of
weeks. I got to feature parity in less than a day!

The euphoria kept me going for a few years: meta-programming was cool, RSpec was
cool, Sequel was cool. The Ruby community was fantastic: it was inclusive and
engaging.

While I loved the language and its ecosystem, I was always uncomfortable to put
Ruby applications to production. I often trivialised the experience saying "No
matter how many tests we add, we still ship typos to production".

Around 2013, I started looking around for something more solid, possibly
faster. I found Go. The language wasn't pretty but I loved how robust programs
felt as soon as they compiled. Even though it was early days for the Go
community, the tooling around the language was already advanced compared to Ruby
(with the obvious exception of dependency management).

I then went back and forth between Ruby and Go for a few years. In 2017, I
summarised [my experience with Go]({{< ref "/writing/my-experience-with-go" >}}
"my experience with go") in a longish article.

Around that time, my interest for Apache Kafka and streaming systems started to
peak. I had already written Kafka applications in C, Ruby, JavaScript, and Go so
I knew that I had to write for the JVM to really exploit Kafka's potential. The
official libraries offered so much more than the community ones and Kafka
Streams - a wonderful streaming library I was very keen on using - was only
available for JVM.

So I reluctantly went back to Java. I told myself "Well, it's going to be
unproductive but I won't have to write my own Kafka Streams library". I was _so
wrong_ about the productivity part, it's almost funny to write about it now.

The developer experience had improved a few orders of magnitude since 2008.
Spring had introduced Spring Boot and the old days of XMLs configurations were
gone. The IDEs were so much faster! Before I knew it, I was doing only Java for
a few years.

This journey is a circle: Java was my first professional programming language,
and it's now my last. While the circle is interesting in itself, the languages I
went through are not what fascinates me. Especially in the context of an article
on the appeal of static typing.

Here's what stands out to me:

- Every time I changed languages, the reasons had nothing to do with language
  features. Also, I was definitely not framing my choice as dynamically typed
  versus statically typed.
- Even though I've never cared much about language features, nowadays I try to
  avoid working with dynamically typed languages. After 2 decades of
  programming, I developed opinions about programming languages 🙃

With this circular journey in mind, let's dive into what makes me say "Yep, I'm
not going to do dynamically typed languages anymore".

## Focus on "actual" tests

I follow a programming principle I call [write "actual" tests]({{< ref
"/writing/my-programming-principles#write-actual-tests" >}} "write actual
tests"). Here's a quick excerpt from the article:

> A test must change only if the behaviour it verifies changed.
>
> No other reason is good enough for a test to change. Which, in turn, means
> “actual tests” only test behaviour. I've seen tests testing language features,
> or missing language features (looking at you dynamically typed languages), or
> framework features.

Those "missing language features" are relevant to the conversation.

Testing dynamically typed code has always been bittersweet for me. On the one
hand, I loved how expressive Ruby was. On the other hand, testing Ruby code made
me a little paranoid. I could pass _anything_ at runtime to every method, so I
had to test everything right?

Also, a good chunk of the tests I wrote made me feel silly. I couldn't help but
think that I was covering the gap for missing language features. I mean static
types of course.

The experience with Go first and then with Java in particular has been very
different. "Actual" tests were easy to write and they were relatively fast.

One trivial example: I can "actually" test a Kafka Streams application with
[Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) with very little effort: add
one dependency here, two lines of code there, and – bam – I've got a running
Kafka instance inside my test.

I like to think that the nature of these languages is the reason why their
communities produce testing tools more apt to my needs. Hard to say but I _do
not_ care enough for the pedant causation versus correlation conversation.

Go and Java allowed me to focus much more on "actual" tests. I enjoy that a lot
for a variety of reasons:

- The compiler covers a lot of ground. I used to write many more tests in
  dynamically typed languages.
- Integrations tests are easier to write because of the available tooling.
- The statically typed languages I worked with are so much faster than the
  dynamically typed ones that it affects testing as well.

## The editing experience

To me, the appeal of static typing is evident when it comes to editing. Here's
what I use right now:

- IntelliJ for Java and Kotlin
- VS code for TypeScript and Go

Both IntelliJ and VS code are _spectacular_ tools. They excel at every aspect of
every-day programming. Be that editing, renaming, refactoring, debugging,
testing. Anything really.

They're both really fast. I ask the question "How on earth is IntelliJ so fast
at doing X?" weekly. Before going back to Java in 2017, I had used IDEs in the
early 2000s and they were horrendously slow back then.

I think the nature of the language does contribute to a better experience.  It's
a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation: Statically typed languages have better
tools because they are easier to write compared to dynamically typed languages.
The tools are easier to write because statically compiled languages are easier
to statically analyse.

Autocompletion is the flagship example of how much better the editing experience
with a statically typed language is.

I remember spending countless hours getting Ruby autocompletion working. It was
never good enough.

The experience with Java or Kotlin is flawless but the best example of this
difference is JavaScript vs. TypeScript. TypeScript autocompletion is so much
better that I think it's enough of a good reason for adoption over JavaScript.

The editing experience is also better for learning purposes. IntelliJ suggests
more idiomatic code all the time. It provides warnings and suggests improvements
based on best practice.

It is a little thing but it has a significant impact on the way I can learn a
language. Let me provide an example:

```java
val favouriteThings = listOf("Raindrops on roses", "Whiskers on kittens")

println(favouriteThings.map { it.lowercase() }.joinToString(" & "))
```

IntelliJ shows a warning on `map` and suggests this:

```java
println(favouriteThings.joinToString(" & ") { it.lowercase() })
```

That's how I learned that `joinToString` takes an optional `transform =  ((Byte)
-> CharSequence)` last parameter (Kotlin has a nice syntactic sugar for so
called trailing lambdas).

The key is that this happens multiple times a day so I end up learning a lot
just by using IntelliJ.

## Shipping code to production

I wish I could attribute the quote I'm about to share but I really don't
remember where I read it:

> Sometimes we forget the most important aspect of writing a program: it has to
> work.

It's beautiful in its simplicity.

How do I know if my code works? Well, of course I have to ship it to production.

Shipping code is where my experience with dynamically typed languages and
statically typed has been the most different. The TL;DR is: dynamically typed
languages make me doubtful about what I'm shipping while statically typed ones
make me confident.

There are a few reasons that contribute to this so let's dive into them.

### Types are docs

This comes up a lot and I can't stress this enough – it's true.

Types act as documentation because of how descriptive and verbose they are. Let
me spell out the obvious: they're together with the rest of code.

Too obvious, right? Well that's the point. The co-location makes types the best
possible kind of documentation:

- They're never out of date
- They're as close as possible to production code

They also help answer questions that come out all the time:

- What does this function return?
- Where do we use this class?
- Can I pass a string to this third-party library method?

What does all of this have to do with shipping code to production? Two things:

- I have to keep fewer things in my head. Types store a lot of metadata
  information for me _in the code_. If I'm not sure about something, I can just
  read the type. This obviously applies to libraries. Yes, I know it's obvious,
  but I mention it anyway because the difference between integrating a Java
  library and a Ruby one has been staggering for me.
- I don't have to care about typos or other silly mistakes like that. I can't
  pass a double to a method expecting a string. Again, all too obvious and I
  wish I could say I never shipped typos to production with Ruby or multiplied a
  string with a number.

### The reading experience

Reading code is a core part of the practice of programming. Shipping code to
production involves a lot of reading. Because of how helpful "types are docs" is
in practice, I find the cognitive load of reading production code written in a
statically typed language significantly smaller than in its dynamic counterpart.

Reading code shows up everywhere in the process of shipping and maintaining
production code:

- I need to figure out where this annoying bug is? I need to read code.
- I need to update the way I use this library? I need to read code.
- I need to help someone ship their code? I need to read code.

Every time I need to read statically typed code, I need to put a little less
effort than when doing so with a dynamically typed language. It adds up pretty
fast. That energy surplus makes me more confident of shipping statically typed
code to production.

### When it compiles, it probably works

This also comes up a lot and I remember being very sceptical of hearing this when I
was working only with dynamically typed languages. I was... wrong.

This, too, is true. The _probably_ part is important because it's not a 100% hit of
course. But the point stands and makes me more confident.

The difference is really evident when I'm trying to rush a bug fix to
production. No matter how careful I am, this situation just happens from time to
time. The last thing I want is to second-guess the fix I'm about to ship. The
compiler telling me that my code "works" reduces cognitive load which I
appreciate even more under pressure.

## Experience is everything

While I tried my best to explain some basic benefits of statically typed
languages, I'm somewhat sure that this article won't convince a single soul. It
was a non-goal for me but it's still interesting to go over why I think my
experience won't convince anyone despite the fact that it did convince me.

Back when I worked only with dynamic languages, I came across these talking
points many times. None of them convinced me. While statically typed languages
and dynamically typed ones are very different in practice, what makes them
different is not one big thing. It's a lot of small, every-day things.

There's something else: it's hard to come across alternatives if you're happy
with what you're doing. Also, there's definitely nothing wrong with being happy
with dynamically typed languages.
