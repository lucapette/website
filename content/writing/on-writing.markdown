Degas is a well-known French painter. Less-known is the fact that he played
around with poetry. One day he explained to the poet Stéphane Mallarmé his
struggle with writing. He said he had many ideas and yet he couldn't write.
Mallarmé answered:

> Poems are not made out of ideas. They're made with words.

This is the best definition of writing I've ever come across.

It's all about the words. The way you connect them, the way you get rid of them.
It's about each sentence you choose, how you craft the rhythm of your sentences.
Varying between short sentenced and longer ones gives a personal touch to your
writing. It helps _my_ writing a great deal. I just did that.

I have always dedicated time to writing but my personal life got in the way of
my fluency. Moving to Germany had a big impact because speaking a different
language at work fundamentally changed the way I think. I often catch myself
thinking in English. I even dream in English. While I'm grateful about the
experience, it had a negative impact on my writing.

I feel limited when I write in English. I know I'm not a native speaker and I
feel it every single time I write. My writing isn't clear and fluid, there's too
much clutter.

I'm a clumsy person in every day life but I've never felt that way about my
writing. My experience at school spoilt me. I was the "good writer" in any
class. I put no effort and yet my writing was good.

The experience gap between my Italian writing and the English one blocked me. I
did not know how to fix it and a few years passed. That's how life works: if you
do nothing, nothing happens. But I couldn't  just give up on writing. I like it
too much. I like the act itself, it calms me down. It gives me the silence
that's so hard to find in this frenetic world.

So I did what I always do when I want to know more about something: I read a few
books. I must confess I was sceptical. I've always thought of writing as
something you're good at; that was my personal experience growing. By now, I'm
know nothing really works like that. You can get better at anything if you work
on it. Reading is my first step when I want to understand something better so
here is a list of the books I read with a short review:

- _The element of style_ It's the classic everyone recommends. Rightly so: it's
  a **must-read**. If you care about improving your English writing, this is the
  book for you. I have not got around to buy a dead-tree version yet, so I'm
  using my Kindle application to consult it every now and then. But it deserves
  to live on one's desk.
- _On writing well_ It's a good book. I loved the first chapters, but I can't
  say I liked the rest of the book as much. After the introduction, each chapter
  covers writing techniques on different topics (like travelling, interviews)
  and some of them were too boring. I did skip some chapters, overall a good
  read.
- _Writing tools_ The above-mentioned books can teach you most of what matters
  about writing in English, so this one may feel a little repetitive. I enjoyed
  it anyway for two reasons:
  - Each chapters comes with a workshop section. The information is helpful and
    actionable. Great features.
  - Some repetition doesn't hurt when you're learning.

These books taught me that writing works like everything else. If you put hours
of practice in something, you will get better. We don't think like that when it
comes to writing though. The problem is that we think of artists as people with
innate talent. You're either born like Dostoevskij or you'll always write crap.

Of course, this isn't true. First of all, the goal isn't becoming the most
important novelist of the history. The goal is to enjoying writing. If you don't
intend to write for money, you can ignore the audience. I suggest you do that
anyway though. More on this later.

## Rewriting is the best part of writing

These books taught me something else too. They changed my perspective on the
writing process. It was a radical and enlightening discovery. They taught me to
love the rewriting process. Before this experience, I had been considering the
following steps:

- Research the topic
- Take notes
- Get the draft

Then I would proof-read the draft with the help of someone else's eyes and I
would call it a day. It was a presumptuous process.

These books, in particular _on writing well_, teach you to love the rewriting
process, they help you understand its value. I started rewriting my drafts on
my. It was a fascinating learning process. My sentences got better, the writing
felt more fluid.

Rewriting my drafts generated some ideas that made me love writing even more. It
forced me to think of ways to get to the first draft as fast and as effortlessly
as possible. That changed everything; two new writing techniques quickly
emerged:

- Note by note.
- Outline expansion.

I couldn't come up with a better naming for now, as a programmer I know how hard
naming can be. I will explain what I mean in the coming paragraphs.

As I kept rewriting my drafts before moving on to proofreading, I realised I had
never written a draft and rewritten it in one sitting. I had always put at least
a few hours between the sessions.

My explanation is that writing and rewriting require different mindsets. When I
write a draft, my goal is to write everything I have in mind so I can move on to
the _real_ work: the rewriting sessions. When I rewrite something, my goal is to
remove all the clutter. I want to get rid of whatever is superfluous:
unnecessary adverbs, adjectives, sentences, entire paragraphs.

When I started to rewrite my drafts, the question "how much rewriting is
enough?" worried me. It's a fair question, it comes up often when I talk about
writing to people.

I can't say if there's an answer that works for everyone. In general, I don't
believe answers have such a feature.

I can share what I do now: I have an upper limit of three sessions. I gave
myself a hard non-negotiable limit because I'm sure there's always room for
improvement. The limit helps me to move on to other things and constrains the
amount of time I spend on a single piece of writing. The time constraint gets
the best out of me. I focus deeply on what I'm writing and those sessions make
me feel satisfied and productive.

## Note by note

I have been trying to write every day for a long time, yet I've struggled to
come up with topics I wanted to write about. A few weeks ago, I started looking
into React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces). I was completely
new to the topic and the ecosystem around React can be overwhelming. I started
taking notes to help me with the learning process. After a couple of coding
sessions I was looking at my notes and I realised I could transform them into a
draft with little effort. That was the first time I used the _note by note_
technique.

So now I take notes about everything I do. I don't care if what I'm writing down
is worth sharing or not. This way I give myself the chance to take a bunch of
notes and transform them into a draft at a later stage.

Nowadays, I can get from notes to a first draft of over a thousand words in
thirty minutes and when I'm about to run out of items in my draft queue, I check
my notes. I always find something I can expand into an article. I found a way to
write every day. It _only_ took me seven years.

## Outline expansion

I use [outlining](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)>) every time I
have no clue what I'm doing. As that's true for most of what I do (and yes,
that's true for you too. Don't lie to yourself my friend), I organise lists this
way every day.

When it comes to writing, it helps me to structure ideas that have been on my
mind for a while. This article is a perfect example. As soon as I started
researching how to improve my English writing, I knew I would want to write
about it at some point so I outlined my thoughts this way:

```
on writing

- use all the day one writing with the "on writing" tag
- Books I read quick review
  - The element of style
  - On writing well
  - Writing tools
- The absolute necessity of getting an editor
- Make a habit out of it
- Build a drafts queue
- Get to the draft as fast as you can:
  - note by note
  - outline with paragraph expansion (use the article itself to explain it)
- Share everything you write (example of the vim article)
```

This is the actual outlined list I used for the article you're reading.  The
outline is a guideline for my thoughts. It works like this:

- I paste the outlined list into my editor.
- I expand one point after the other.
- If a point doesn't fit where it is, I move past it.
- If I'm left with points I couldn't expand, I get rid of them.

As you can see from the example above, "make a habit out it" and "the absolute
necessity of getting an editor" did not make it to the final article. I believe
they are important topics but I couldn't find a way to make them flow with the
rest of the content.

Furthermore, "get to the draft as fast as you can" ended up being three
different paragraphs. While writing the article, I realised I cared too much
about "rewriting", so only mentioning it didn't work.

As with the "note by note" technique, I try to expand all the points in one
session, but it doesn't always work. Sometimes I get tired of using this
technique, because I don't have enough content in the outline list already. In
that sense, the "note by note" technique works better.

For example, I wrote the first draft of this article in one sitting. It took me
less than two hours and I couldn't be happier with the result. But it was almost
1900 words and the writing session left me very tired.

## Share everything you write

We have the tendency to overestimate our forecasting capabilities. It's called
[overconfidence effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect). I
feel the effect of this bias every time I publish something.

2017 is a perfect example: the only article I thought wasn't worth sharing got
more attention than the rest put together. I couldn't believe it.

So I decided that the best strategy against this bias is to ignore it
completely. I won't ask myself if an article is worth sharing or not. I'll share
whatever I write because I love writing.

Besides, from time to time someone tells me they found my writing helpful. It's
a beautiful thought: I do something just because I like it and that helps
someone else. Why wouldn't I take that chance every time I write something?
