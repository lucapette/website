{{< message class="is-info">}} This is a _long_ read. You will find a table of
 contents right after the introduction. {{</ message >}}

In my career, I've worked in very different industries, covering all kinds of
product development roles. Two patterns emerged early on and stayed with me ever
since:

- I have built teams and systems from scratch many many times.
- I have always had direct reports.

Looking back, I find this a tad puzzling.

Some sort of a strange chicken-and-egg problem I can't untangle: Do I _always_
find myself in leading positions because I'm good at it, or did I become good at
it because I've _always_ had to lead people?

To be honest, I'm not so sure what's the right answer.

I bring this up in the introduction of an article called "my engineering
management values" because it's relevant to the conversation. Two reasons:

- I'm self-assessing as a "good leader".
- I've been in leadership positions literally all my career.

Both are worth addressing before I move forward to discuss my values. Especially
for readers that do not know me personally (if that's you, hey ðŸ‘‹ nice to meet
you!). Let's start from "good leader".

What makes a good leader? My answer is "many things but everything derives from
trust". The people you manage trust you to have their back. They are confident that your focus
as a leader is their growth and well-being.

As I believe trust is what makes a good leader, it's somewhat obvious that
it is the common denominator of all my values.

What's also worth noticing is that I use "leader" instead of "engineering manager". It's
is a conscious choice that allows me to make a small distinction.

While it's true I have been in positions of leadership most of my career, I have
never held the title of engineering manager. More specifically, I've never been
responsible only for the people part of leading developers.

I underline this because I can back up "I'm a good leader" with examples from my
career, but I can't actually say "I'm a good engineering manager". In fact, I'm
not so sure I'm a good fit for the job.

That's the other thing I wanted to underline: I do not know how to gain trust
from developers without deep technical conversations.

From my exchanges with engineering manager friends, these conversations are
somewhat rare and just tangential to the job so I believe I'd have a hard time in
that role.

I'm not saying that these conversations are the only way to gain developers'
trust. I'm providing context for what my experience has been so far, so when I
outline my values, it will be clear how I apply them to the job.

Before I move on to the values themselves, I'd like to explain why I think that 
leading teams all my career is also relevant to this article.

In every single job I took I felt a little "tricked" into leading developers. I
did _not_ want to lead developers and took on the jobs because:

- It was easy for me. More about this in a minute.
- I would rather lead a team so I could self-organise my own time than "just" be
  a team member and have a terrible manager. Unfortunately, every single manager
  I've had apart from one (hey [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabiansiegel) ðŸ‘‹) has
  been either extremely terrible or really terrible.

Nowadays, I know that these are not good reasons to lead teams so, at the time
of writing, I'm not sure there's an engineering leadership job in my future.

When I say "it was easy for me", I'm not trying to brag. It's kind of a sad
thought really. Let me explain.

I've always thought that my "leadership style" is nothing special:

- **Trust** the people
- Treat them with respect
- Convince them to do something instead of telling them what to do
- Let them make mistakes
- Make sure they understand your no-go (I'll provide examples of this in [lead
by example](#lead-by-example)).

The average manager out there must be very bad if doing what I've just listed is
enough to be a good one. Often "the best I had".

The sad thought is that it felt very easy to be better than the average.

With that out of the way, let's dive in.

## One-on-ones

One-on-ones are the very core of my leadership style. I would not know how to
lead without them.

My goal with one-on-ones is to create a safe environment where my direct reports
and I can trust each other. As you may have guessed by now, it's all about trust
for me.

There is a lot of advice around how to structure and how to run one-to-ones. I
can't offer any of that though as I actively try to avoid structure. What drives
my approach is this:

> People are different and you want to treat them differently. You do not want
> to treat all of them the same way: you want to be equally _fair_ with all of
> them.

I don't plan one-on-ones because my job is to listen. I leave enough room for
the other person to make use of the meeting the way they want.

The way I do this is the simplest: I ask people how they want to use the
meeting. They know better than me what they are struggling with.

I provide discussion topics only if asked to. That happens more often with
younger developers. In fact, their most common struggle is that they don't know
what good or bad looks like yet.

If people want to talk about things that are not work related, I do not drive the
conversation back to work.

There is one thing I do plan carefully though: my action points after a one-to-one.

Creating a safe space for people to tell me what bothers them and
what their aspirations are comes with great expectations. People trusted me so now
I have to "prove" they did the right thing.

It took me too long to understand I needed to take great care of the action
points that a one-on-one generates.

That is the main reason why I think you can hardly have more than 5 or 6
direct reports _and_ do a good job at the same time. It is too much work and too
much information.

One-on-ones make sense only as a recurring meeting, so their frequency is
relevant to the conversation. I don't choose or have a standard frequency.

Different people have different needs, I let them choose how often they want to
meet. My only requirement is an upper bound: not less frequently than once per month.

It can be once per month, once per week, every day, or whatever. In my
experience, the frequency tends to stabilise between every two weeks and once
per month.

I keep the meeting informal and, if people are fine with it, we do it outside of the
typical office setup. This helps you reinforce the message 
"this meeting has a special meaning because it is only about you".

The meetings will be more formal with some people and "exactly like going for a
coffee" with other people. Both are fine.

In 2015, I wrote some [notes about one-on-ones]({{< ref
"/writing/some-notes-about-one-on-ones" >}} "some notes about one on ones").
If you're looking for more details, I revised the article in 2022.

## Written communication

I was, and still am, a big fan of in-person, face-to-face, meetings. They worked
great for me as a leader when I had small teams to take care of.

I still use this approach as my primary communication style when I can.

When I started leading more than one team (defined by the two-pizza rule) at the
time, I quickly realised that this communication style wouldn't scale.

Lots of people felt out of the loop, there was no structure around how my teams
took decisions.

It made sense: my communication style was, by definition, non-inclusive. Either
you were there or you weren't.

I started writing things down for my teams and never looked back ever since.
It's now my favourite communication style to broadcast information.

I treat written communication channels very differently from each other. Written
words shouldn't always have the same weight. The context matters quite a bit.
Let me break it down.

### Chats

I'm deliberately silly in chats. I make jokes. I police people out of slack
threads if the conversation gets serious.

This attitude is designed to constantly send the message that chats aren't the
place for any serious work.

I may use chats as a secondary broadcast channel. Meaning I link important
writing living somewhere else (like a google doc or a github issue) in a chat
and remind the team to discuss anything related to it in the relevant place.

### Design proposals

When I'm designing a non trivial feature, I most often use google docs as a
starting point.

It's an approach that is very indicative of my leadership style: I want to make
sure we're going in a direction I'm comfortable with (so I often draft a first
version) while making sure people have the time and place to contribute as much
as possible to the design.

I love the approach: it's more inclusive than a meeting because it doesn't
require any attendance at a specific time while also requiring less maintenance
from me as a moderator.

Discussions in written form tend to be more thoughtful than in-person ones
because people have time to think things through.

I also require people in my teams to approach large features this way. My
experience has been that forcing people to write down their plans improves the
quality of the plans themselves.

### Meeting agendas

Writing detailed meeting agendas is a relatively cheap way to ensure meetings
are useful and correctly moderated.

I write down meeting invitations in this form:

- The point of the meeting
- The topics we want to cover (order often relevant)
- The expected outcome

This simplifies my job a little as I can quickly context-switch into "meeting
mode" as soon as I read the agenda. This also helps me moderate the meeting.

If the meeting is about some on-going topic, I most likely have a google doc
attached to it so that we can take real-time notes.

If this seems like a lot of work to set up a meeting, it's because that's the
point.

If I'm demanding people to take time out of their day, it means the topics are
important. My effort should reflect that.

I enforce a "no agenda no meeting" policy when it makes sense. While I
personally like it very much, I found that meeting culture is too 
company-specific for such a strict rule to always work.

### Developer book

Early in my career I got very frustrated every time I joined a new team. Most of
the day-by-day operations were just not documented.

So when it was my time to design an on-boarding experience, I realised I could
make use of written communication by creating a "developer book".

This document provides at least the following information:

- How to on-board
- How we work
- How we operate
- How to off-board

The idea is that if someone is unsure about how to approach a problem, they have
some starting point in the developer book.

I store the developer book wherever the team stores code because it allows me
to implement a process I find beautiful in its simplicity: I ask my teams to
discuss changes to processes via pull-requests to the developer book.

The developer book in the repository then becomes the point of reference for every
discussion about the way the teams operate.

It achieves some things I value very much:

- The rest of pull-requests (meaning code) stay free from tangential
  conversations about style, conventions and what not (those would be defined in
  the developer book as "how we work").
- Your team will have a history of how operational decisions were made.
- The developer book is always in sync. Can you believe I had teams with
  up-to-date docs?

Of course, the list of topics I provided is only an example. Different companies
have different needs, so the developer book should reflect that.

Good examples of topics you may want to cover in the document are:

- Diagrams (sequences, architecture)
- Incident management
- Reference readings

### Internal blogging

I call this communication channel "internal blogging" for the lack of a better term.
What I mean is that I always have a place where I can share long pieces of
writing.

I want to be able to refer to specific content over time. I found that
repetition is very much needed when leading any group of people.

Writing a "blog post" is also my favourite way to smooth difficult operational
transitions that occur in the lifetime of a company.

For example, I wrote internal blog posts on "the benefits of moving to a
mono-repository", "why we're going to use trunk based development", or "the next
generation of our Kafka infrastructure".

I share such blog posts long before the actual transition happens. This gives me
time to collect feedback and minimise the situations in which a change occurs and
people don't know about it.

As teams scale, sharing knowledge becomes more and more important to make sure
that different teams don't solve the same problem multiple times. An internal blog is
a simple way to share these learnings.

That's the other main reason why I write these blog posts. It paves the way for
other people to write.

Fostering a culture of writing helps teams in many ways:

- Learning to be a better writer helps you become a better developer.
- People can proudly share their achievements and simultaneously help other team
  members to learn something new.

The first question that comes to mind is: What is the right topic for blog posts?
A good answer is whatever people feel like sharing as long as it's work related.

It only works if people use it as an actual technical blog, because that is the
only way to ensure that the usage spreads among team members.

Bonus side-effect: internal blogging makes public blogging much easier.

The delta between "something we wrote for ourselves" and "something we want to
share with the world" is often small, so internal blogging facilitates public
blogging.

A public blog is a great marketing activity for your teams, it helps with hiring
and improves the mood of your teams. It can feel great to share what you are
doing with the rest of the world.

## Lead by example

I believe leading by example is the best way to shape culture.

> Instead of telling people how to behave, be the person you want your direct
> reports to be.

Leading by example does wonders because it is self-reproducing. People have the
tendency to emulate the behaviour of those they trust.

If people trust me as a leader, I can shape the culture of my team _just_ by
doing what I think is right.

This applies to everything we do at work every day, so I often felt
overwhelmed by the idea that "people are observing my behaviour".

The way I overcame this problem is by making sure I make a conscious effort to
draw the boundaries of my values.

The idea is that I clarify, with daily examples, what the things I really
care about are. Let me provide some real-world examples from my teams:

- I call out people when they use non-inclusive language.
- I leave at 6pm every day unless the system is on fire.
- I don't give up on a disruptive production issue unless it's solved.
- I don't have work chat apps on my phone.
- I don't work outside of working hours.
- You can't really reach me when I'm off.

These are just examples, the point is: I learned that you can't tell people to do
"the right thing" and expect them to follow you. You have to be the person
that does "the right thing".

It's obviously harder to lead by example when the teams grow. Most of the people
will not interact with me every day so I can't really provide daily examples.

Once again, written communication comes very handy. I write down "do and don't"
documents for the team.

These documents look a little like the list I just shared but they use a
different writing style. Items look like "Use inclusive language" or "it's
always OK to ask questions".

## Fire fast, hire slow

Most startups hire fast and fire slow and that is considered somehow normal. I
apply the reversed principle: hire slow and fire fast.

This sounds great in theory but, to be fair, it is hard in practice because:

- You could always do more with more people.
- Hiring has no short-term positive performance effect on your teams.

So there's quite some incentive on hiring people really fast especially in a "VC
backed startup".

Unfortunately, hiring cannot fix _now_ problems. It is an investment for the
future of your teams.

I try to stay ahead of my own needs and hire just a little before I actually
need more people.

This also helps me to make sure I can actually hire slowly. While I'm
interviewing people, I'm not trying to solve a now problem, so I can take my time
with it.

Hiring slow is how I minimise false positives. If I hire the wrong people, the
best I can do is to fire them.

Unfortunately, that is an awful solution. Firing is _always_ my failure:
something went wrong and now there is no better option than giving up.

Firing is ugly, there is no better way to put it. That is why I do it as soon as
possible.

I think of firing as the worst possible outcome of the on-boarding process which
I organise in the following checkpoints:

- First day
- First week
- First month
- First quarter

There is more to on-boarding than just looking for hiring failure, but let me
focus on that aspect here.

In the first few days, I only look for big red alerts. The kind of inappropriate
behaviour that must result in immediate firing; sexist or racist behaviour comes
to mind.

[IN THE FIRST WEEK?]

The one-month checkpoint is the first chance for both parties to ask themselves
if they did the right thing. It is generally enough time to assess if you enjoy
working together or not.

At the three-month checkpoint, I ask myself the question "do we to work together
for the next X years?"

If the answer is not "Of course, it's awesome!" I know there's a problem to fix
and have to act fast.

Sometimes though, people do not fit anymore. They have been working with you for
a while and they realise they are not happy anymore.

Companies are living entities and they often evolve too fast. There is nothing
wrong with it.

In such cases, I pay extra attention to how I let people go. It is easy for
both parties to show lack of care and leave behind a bad feeling.

The solution is to talk about it as much as possible. They helped you achieve
your goals, now it is your turn to show them you appreciate what they have done.

The best possible outcome is to help them find a new job and ensure a smooth
transition.

Unfortunately, some people do not behave nicely in their last weeks. It can
happen even with people you really liked working with. It is human: their heart
is somewhere else already and they cannot help it.

Observe the situation closely. If it gets unprofessional, talk to them and let
them go as soon as possible. It is the best option for both parties.

## No privileges

In most environments, there is some degree of privilege when it comes to
specific topics like deployment rights, access to different environments. A
common explanation for these privileges is risk mitigation. Those in charge want
to minimise the mistakes made so they grant privileged access only to a handful
of people.

This approach creates a false sense of security but in fact it doesn't help you
do better than any other company out there. Everyone has outages and breaks
things like everybody else.

In reality, such privileges create the worst dynamic: it frustrates newer team
members because they cannot access some of the knowledge that would increase
their seniority. It makes sure only senior people can make mistakes.

So at some point in my career, I got rid of all privileges because I realised
that:

> Everyone can do everything, but this does not mean that everyone will.

On average, not much changed in terms of risk. I did not get more outages but I
saw people grow faster.

I apply the "no privileges" policy aggressively. People should not be confined
to only one phase of the product development process.

It is important to let people freely develop in the direction they want.

This approach often led to internal hiring (which is the best kind of hiring)
because people started trying new things (because they could!) and realised they
liked them more than their current job.

## Be vulnerable

[Leading teams by example](#lead-by-example) has an obvious downside: people
tend to imitate your mistakes too.

It has always been difficult for me to see people consider my own mistakes
as acceptable behaviour.

When I figure out I made a mistake, I go with radical honesty about it.

I tell my team why what I did is a mistake, I apologise, and commit to do
better.

This too is leading by example, because that's precisely the kind of behaviour I
want to see in the people I work with. The message is:

- It is OK to make mistakes.
- This behaviour is not up to my own values.
- I must do better.
- So must everyone else.

This dynamic has a positive effect on you too. Being a good leader means helping
people go wherever they want to go.

Sharing your own mistakes with your team can be a powerful moment of
self-reflection and can get you closer to your direct reports.
