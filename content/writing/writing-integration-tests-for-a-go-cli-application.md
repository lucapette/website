title: Writing integration tests for a Go CLI application

I've recently open sourced a small Go CLI application for random data
generation. I'm working on an application for which I continuously need testing
data, so I did some research on the subject. As I couldn't find exactly what I
was looking for, I decided to write a small Go CLI application to solve this
problem. CLI applications are one of my favourite use cases for Go, and I knew
I'd enjoy writing it. A few weeks after I released
[fakedata](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata), [Kevin
Gimbel](https://twitter.com/_kevinatari) found a
[bug](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata/issues/12). The issue was a direct
consequence of a feature we introduced the same day Kevin found the bug. It was
an obvious regression, and fakedata clearly had no tests covering the feature
end to end.

This issue made me think about how to test a CLI application end to end. I
wanted to do something like:

- create a binary of the CLI app
- run the binary with some specific argument
- assert correct behaviour

I managed to get it done [here](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata/pull/14)
and decided to share the key ingredients that made this a simple and effective
way of writing integration tests for a Go CLI application. I created an example
application for the sake of the discussion, it's available
[here](https://github.com/lucapette/go-cli-integration-tests).

I use `make` to build my Go applications, it suits the task well and it gives me
a very short command to build an entire project (as `build` is the de-facto
default target, building a project is as easy as typing `make` and hitting
enter). In this case, the
[Makefile](https://github.com/lucapette/go-cli-integration-tests/blob/main/Makefile)
builds a tiny program called `echo-args`. The program works like this:

```sh
$ echo-args # no arguments, no output
$
$ echo-args ciao # it prints each argument on its own line
$ ciao
$ echo-args ciao hello
ciao
hello
$ echo -shout ciao # it shouts at you if you ask it to
CIAO
```

Four different test cases should cover everything. But first we need to build
the binary. Here is the code I used for that:

```go
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	err := os.Chdir("..")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("could not change dir: %v", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	make := exec.Command("make")
	err = make.Run()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("could not make binary for %s: %v", binaryName, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	os.Exit(m.Run())
}
```

Two things are worth mentioning:

- [TestMain](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Main) is the recommended way to
  do setup and teardown of tests
- `os.Chdir("..")` is _ugly but practical_ (a bit like Go you may want to say).
  It works but it's neither a general nor a robust solution.

Since this code runs before any of the tests, I can assume there's going to be a
binary of the CLI application I can use to run the program and assert the
correctness of its output. Here is the test I wrote to cover the four cases:

```go
func TestCliArgs(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		name    string
		args    []string
		fixture string
	}{
		{"no arguments", []string{}, "no-args.golden"},
		{"one argument", []string{"ciao"}, "one-argument.golden"},
		{"multiple arguments", []string{"ciao", "hello"}, "multiple-arguments.golden"},
		{"shout arg", []string{"--shout", "ciao"}, "shout-arg.golden"},
	}

	for _, tt := range tests {
		t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			dir, err := os.Getwd()
			if err != nil {
				t.Fatal(err)
			}

			cmd := exec.Command(path.Join(dir, binaryName), tt.args...)
			output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
			if err != nil {
				t.Fatal(err)
			}

			if *update {
				writeFixture(t, tt.fixture, output)
			}

			actual := string(output)

			expected := loadFixture(t, tt.fixture)

			if !reflect.DeepEqual(actual, expected) {
				t.Fatalf("actual = %s, expected = %s", actual, expected)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

The tests use two of my favourite Go testing practices:

- Golden files
- [TableDrivenTests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests)

While Table Driven tests officially documented, I couldn't find anything about
golden files. The basic idea is to:

- store on disk (in so-called golden files) the expected (and possibly complex)
  output of the code under test
- then use a simple comparison of the actual output and the content of
  corresponding golden file.

It's a good practice to use a command line flag to automatically update the
golden file when the specified behaviour changes:

```sh
go test integration/cli_test.go -update
```

and then check the golden file before running the tests again. Here is the
output on my machine:

```sh
go-cli-integration-tests main ➜ make test
go test ./...
?       github.com/lucapette/go-cli-integration-tests/cmd       [no test files]
ok      github.com/lucapette/go-cli-integration-tests/integration       0.267s
```

While this is a trivial example, I think it's still pretty amazing that building
the binary, running it four times, loading four files, and asserting the
correctness of the problem takes as little time as `0.267s`. The integration
tests run nicely on [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/lucapette/go-cli-integration-tests/actions) as well.

Thanks to TableDrivenTests, covering more use cases is simple. Say `echo-args`
now accepts a `reverse` flag, we can test the new behaviour with one more line:

```go
tests := []struct {
		name    string
		args    []string
		fixture string
	}{
        // existing tests not shown
		{"reversed", []string{"--reverse", "ciao", "hello"}, "reversed.golden"},
	}
```

I **really** like it takes so little to test a relatively complex behaviour.

The tests make only two assumptions: how to build the binary (running `make` in
a specific directory) and the name of the binary. If you would change the
internals of the program completely, the tests would still be untouched:

> The tests need to change only if the behaviour of the program changes

That which is the **only** kind of testing I'm comfortable with. Just to
highlight the point of this benefit even more: the binary doesn't even have to
be a Go program :)

I enjoy using this technique, hopefully you will too. Happy testing with Go!
