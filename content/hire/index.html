    <span class="dropcap">Hi!</span>
  </span>
  <span class="sr-only">Hi!</span>

  My name is Luca Pette (He/Him) and I'm a polyglot developer (Java, JavaScript,
  TypeScript, Go, Kotlin) <span class="accent">available</span> for hire.
</p>

<p> Check out my
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucapette/">Linkedin</a> profile for a
  detailed overview of my work experience and education.
</p>

<h2>Why hire me?</h2>

<p>Over the past two decades, I've run engineering teams in a wide variety of
contexts: corporations, family-run businesses, early stage startups.</p>

<p>
In each of these contexts, a recurring theme emerged: <span
class="accent"><b>I built many teams and systems from scratch</b></span>.
</p>

<p>Since I've always been in a position of leadership in the past 15 years, I have
experience building and running infrastructure, backend, data, frontend, and
mobile systems.</p>

<p>I wrote detailed articles about both aspects of my career:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/writing/my-programming-principles">My programming principles</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/writing/my-engineering-management-values">My engineering management values</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>As a programmer, I'm the most fluent solving infrastructure, data, and
backend problems. That's where I've spent most of my programming career.</p>

<p>While designing UI and UX is not my strong suit, I have lots of experience
building JavaScript and TypeScript applications. I'm also very fond of React.</p>

<h2>What am I looking for?</h2>

<p>As a freelancer, I've been hired in all kinds of positions: ad-interim CTO,
  programmer, hiring manager, and so on.</p>

<p>So apart from some <a href="#deal-breakers">deal breakers</a>, I can work in
any capacity.</p>

<p>I get the most excited when I can work on <span
class="accent"><b>infrastructure</b></span> (especially development
infrastructure like testing pipelines, build tools) or
<span class="accent"><b>streaming data platforms</b></span> (I have lots of
experience with Apache Kafka, its ecosystem, and streaming platforms in
general).</p>

<p>While I would advise you not to hire freelancers for leading your teams, I'm
OK with ad-interim roles if the project excites me.</p>

<p>I prefer working on one large, difficult problem at a time over many simple
problems one after the other.</p>

<p>Solving one large problem at a time often leads to a long-lasting mutually
beneficial working relationship because this is where my technical and leadership
skills converge.</p>

<p>I'm good at breaking down large problems into small, simple artifacts. I can
write design proposals for them and coordinate the work.</p>

<p>I tend to get bored after a few weeks if the problems I'm working on are all
simple.</p>

<p>I can do that quite efficiently though because leading engineering teams made
me pretty good at context switching.</p>

<h2 id="deal-breakers">Dealbreakers</h2>

<p>
  While I enjoy working pretty much on any product, do <b>not</b> contact me for
  anything <b>blockchain</b>, and <b>military</b> related.
</p>

<p>
  I also tend to say no to anything related to advertising. I may want to make an
  exception if both of the following conditions are met:
  <ul>
    <li>The technological stack is highly relevant to me.</li>
    <li>The goal of the project you want to hire me for is performance related.
    Making systems use less resources is climate friendly.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>At the moment, I cannot take 40-hour per week contracts.</p>
