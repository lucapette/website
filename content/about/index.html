  <span class="sr-only">Hi!</span>
  My name is Luca Pette (He/Him) and I was born in Napoli (land of 🍕 and ☀️) in
  1982. Since the summer of 2012, I have been living in Berlin (land of 🥙 and
  🌥). </p>

<p>This is a <span class="has-text-weight-bold">personal</span> page, a
collection of random facts about me. At the moment, I'm on a sabbatical. I will
add a professional page when I'm back to work.
</p>

<p> 
  If you're still here (thank you 😊!), here's the list:
  <ul>
    <li>I love playing guitars</li>
    <li>I enjoy cooking very much</li>
    <li>I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41861912-luca" alt="Luca
    Pette's goodreads.com profile page">read a lot</a> and I'm really fast at
    it</li>
    <li>I have a computer science degree but I never collected the official
    papers</li>
    <li>I speak way too much</li>
  </ul>
